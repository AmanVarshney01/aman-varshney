## Introduction

A queue is a data structure that stores items in a First In First Out (FIFO) manner. This means that the first item to be inserted into the queue is the first one to be removed.

we can implement a queue using an array or a linked list. In this article, we will implement a queue using a linked list.

we will use the concepts of templates, pointers, and object-oriented programming.

## Queue Operations

- Enqueue: Adds an item to the queue.
- Dequeue: Removes an item from the queue.
- Peek: Returns the front item of the queue without removing it.
- IsEmpty: Checks if the queue is empty.

## Queue Implementation

we will start by defining all the methods and variables that we will need in our queue class.

```cpp

template <typename T> // T The type of elements stored in the Queue.
class Queue {

private:

    struct Node {
        T value; // Value of the node
        Node* next; // Pointer to the next node

        Node() {

        }
    };

    Node* head; // Pointer to the first node in the queue
    Node* tail; // Pointer to the last node in the queue

public:

    int length; // Number of elements in the queue

    Queue() {

    }

    void enqueue(T value) {

    }

    T dequeue() {

    }

    T peek() {

    }
};

int main () {

    // Queue q;

    return 0;
}

```

### Queue class

The Queue class has two private pointers, head and tail, which point to the first and last nodes in the queue respectively.
It also has a public integer length which keeps track of the number of elements in the queue.
To make the queue generic, we will use templates.

```cpp
Queue() {
    this->head = nullptr;
    this->tail = nullptr;
    this->length = 0;
}
```

The constructor initializes an empty queue. head and tail are set to nullptr and length is set to 0.

### Node Structure

The Queue is implemented using a linked list.
Each node in the list contains a value of a generic type T and a pointer to the next node.
The Node structure is defined within the Queue class and is private,
meaning it can only be accessed by members of the Queue class.

```cpp
struct Node {
    T value;
    Node* next;

    Node( T value, Node* next = nullptr) {
        this->value = value;
        this->next = next;
    }
};
```

Node constructor takes two arguments, the value of the node and a pointer to the next node.
The default value of the next pointer is nullptr. Sets the value and next variables to the passed arguments.
